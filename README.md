# My Eagle EDA Parts Library

This is my personal part and component library for Eagle CAD/EDA. Many of
these I've created from scratch based on datasheets and some I borrowed from
other sources I have confidence in, have modified for consistency and accuracy
or have tested personally.

The components are believed to be correct and accurate. I use these in my own
projects but as is always the case your experience and standards may differ. I
offer these without warranty or claim of suitability for your application. You
should always verify components against their datasheets and build a
prototype to physically confirm everything before committing to a large
production order. Use good sense, trust nobody, assume nothing. You've been
warned.
